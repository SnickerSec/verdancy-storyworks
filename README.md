# Verdancy Storyworks Website Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

The goal of this project is to create a professional and engaging website for Verdancy Storyworks. The site will serve as the central hub for the book series, focusing on promotion, community building, and direct sales. The design and user experience will be heavily influenced by the futuristic, post-apocalyptic aesthetic of the books.

**Primary Goals:**

- Showcase the book series and individual titles.
- Provide a platform for readers to learn more about the lore, characters, and author.
- Drive traffic to book purchasing links (e.g., Amazon, B&N).
- Build a community and capture newsletter sign-ups.

## 2. Thematic Design & Aesthetics

Based on the art and content you've shared, the website's design should capture a sense of a high-tech future that has fallen into disrepair.

- **Visual Style:** A gritty, yet sophisticated dystopian aesthetic. The interface should feel both futuristic and weathered, as if it's running on salvaged technology.
- **Color Palette:** A dark, moody base (deep grays, muted blacks) with strategic use of vibrant, neon accent colors (electric blue, deep magenta, glowing green) to highlight interactive elements and key information.
- **Typography:** A combination of a clean, modern sans-serif font for body text and a glitch-style or retro-futuristic font for titles and headers.
- **User Interface (UI) Elements:** Use subtle visual effects like static, digital "glitches," scan lines, or faded holographic textures. Buttons and links should have a clear, glowing hover state.
- **Imagery:** Use high-quality imagery from the book series, including cover art, character illustrations, and concept art, to reinforce the theme.

## 3. Key Features & Content Modules

### **Landing Page**

- **Hero Section:** High-impact visual (animated header or key art) with a clear call-to-action to explore the books.
- **Latest Release:** A dedicated section showcasing the most recent book in the series.
- **Series Overview:** A brief, compelling introduction to the world and story.
- **Newsletter Signup:** A prominent form to capture email addresses.

### **Books Section**

- **Series Page:** A page detailing all the books in the series in chronological order.
- **Individual Book Pages:** Each book will have its own dedicated page with:
  - High-resolution cover art.
  - Official synopsis.
  - Excerpt from the book.
  - Purchase links.
  - Reader reviews/testimonials.

### **About Section**

- **Verdancy Storyworks:** A page outlining the vision and mission of the publisher.
- **Author Bio:** A profile of the author(s) with a photo and background information.

### **News/Blog**

- A section for updates, behind-the-scenes content, and lore articles.

### **Contact & Social Media**

- A contact form for inquiries.
- Clearly visible links to the Verdancy Storyworks social media accounts.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We can use a modern framework like React or Vue for more interactive elements.
- **CMS (Content Management System):** A headless CMS (like Strapi, Contentful) or a simple static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo) would be ideal to manage content easily without a developer for every update.
- **Hosting:** A reliable web hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) that can handle media-rich content.
