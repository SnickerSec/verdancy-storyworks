# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Verdancy Storyworks website project - a professional website for a book series featuring a futuristic, post-apocalyptic aesthetic. The site serves as a central hub for book promotion, community building, and direct sales.

## Current State

This repository currently contains only planning documentation. The actual website implementation has not yet begun.

## Planned Technology Stack

According to the project plan in README.md:
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript with potential React or Vue.js framework
- **CMS:** Headless CMS (Strapi, Contentful) or static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo)
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify

## Project Structure (Planned)

The website will include:
- Landing page with hero section and newsletter signup
- Books section with individual book pages
- About section (publisher and author info)
- News/blog section
- Contact and social media integration

## Design Requirements

- **Theme:** Gritty, sophisticated dystopian aesthetic
- **Color Palette:** Dark base (grays, blacks) with neon accents (electric blue, magenta, green)
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif for body text, glitch-style/retro-futuristic for headers
- **Effects:** Subtle visual effects like static, glitches, scan lines, holographic textures

## Development Notes

Since this is a new project with no existing codebase:
1. Technology stack decisions need to be finalized based on project requirements
2. Development setup will depend on chosen framework
3. Asset management will be important due to media-rich content (book covers, artwork)
4. Newsletter integration and purchase link management will be key features
